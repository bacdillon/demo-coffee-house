                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>
                Founded in 1999, La Nonna was born from a love for traditional Italian cooking. Our founder, Maria Rossi, grew up in a small village in Italy, where she learned to cook from her grandmother. Inspired by these cherished family recipes, Maria decided to bring the flavors of Italy to Singapore. Today, La Nonna continues to honor those traditions while embracing new culinary innovations.
                <br><br>
                La Nonna was created to capture the soul of authentic Italian cooking, time-honored recipes passed down from Italian grandmothers. Our very first outlet opened its doors in November 2006 without much fanfare but gradually accrued a loyal following among enthusiasts looking for understated comfort and good food served with warm Italian hospitality. 
                <br><br>
                La Nonna paints the picture of Italian countryside with a modern touch, featuring a traditional bronze oven, deep wood decor, taupe-coloured walls adorned with vintage Italian posters and shelves displaying antique lamps and old wine bottles, reminiscent of the warmth of Grandmaâ€™s proudly owned house. 
                <br><br>
                La Nonna is not just great for cosy gatherings amongst friends and family, its soft lighting also makes it perfect for a romantic date                <p><b>THAT SITS IN THE HEART OF HOLLAND VILLAGE</b></p>
